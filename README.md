### Installing OpenCV

The proper way to install OpenCV is by building the source: https://opencv.org/releases.html

For today, you can just install it via a pip package. **Only do this if you don't already have OpenCV, multiple installations will conflict**. 

***Important, use pip3 if you have multiple Python installations***

```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```
Troubleshooting: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/

#### Other methods of installation, based on your environment:

Anaconda: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html
OpenCV through Anaconda here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-opencv-anaconda-environm…/

On Mac, via Homebrew: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/…/install-opencv-3-on-macos-…/

On Linux, build from source:
